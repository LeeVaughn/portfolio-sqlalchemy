# Portfolio with SQLAlchemy

This is a online portfolio built with Flask and SQLAlchemy.

To run the application first activate the virtual environment which is named `env` and then run the `appy.py` file.

This project was built as part of the Treehouse Python Techdegree. In building it I learned more about Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy.
